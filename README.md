# Castell Image Classification (CNN - TensorFlow)

## Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow** to classify images of three traditional Catalan human towers (**castells**):

- `pd5` – *Pilar de 5*
- `2d7` – *Torre de 7*
- `4d8` – *Quatre de 8*

The model can automatically recognize and distinguish between these castell types from photos.

## Features
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- CNN architecture with TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training, validation, and evaluation
- Predictions on unseen images
